## Hi!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my latest project, ClassMaster, a educational software solution that isn't quite an LMS.
- 🤖 I'm also working on the programming for the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). Go Rancho Reapers (team 8533)!  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java (I mostly program in TypeScript/JS currently)
